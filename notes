SPL
boolean operator precedence NOT OR AND
use ( ) to change order of precedence
use " " to search for exact phrase
use backslash \ to escape " if search term includes "


Search Terms - self explanatory
Commands - tells Splunk what to do with the search results, including creating charts, statistics and formatting
Functions - explain how to chart, compute and evaluate results
Arguments - the variables to apply to the function
Clauses - explain how results are grouped or defined
search terms, command names, functions and clauses are not case sensitive 
BUT commands for a specific value are case sensitive

Performance
using time to limit search results is most efficient 
limit search scope before | will also improve performance
limit by index, source, host, sourcetype to improve performance as these terms are extracted when data is initially indexed
limit by more specific terms
inclusion is better than exclusion
