SPL
boolean operator precedence NOT OR AND
use ( ) to change order of precedence
use " " to search for exact phrase
use backslash \ to escape " if search term includes "


Search Terms - self explanatory
Commands - tells Splunk what to do with the search results, including creating charts, statistics and formatting
Functions - explain how to chart, compute and evaluate results
Arguments - the variables to apply to the function
Clauses - explain how results are grouped or defined
search terms, command names, functions and clauses are not case sensitive 
BUT commands for a specific value are case sensitive

Performance
using time to limit search results is most efficient 
limit search scope before | will also improve performance
limit by index, source, host, sourcetype to improve performance as these terms are extracted when data is initially indexed
limit by more specific terms
inclusion is better than exclusion ex: "access denied" is better than NOT "access granted"
use the OR or IN rather than wildcards*  ex:  "user=admin OR user=administrator" , user IN (admin, administrator)

Knowledge Objects
5 types of data knowledge objects
  
  Interpretation - fields, field extractions, calculated fields
  Classification - event types, transactions
  Enrichment - lookups, workflow actions
  Normalization - tags, field aliases
  Models - hierarchically structured datasets
A knowledge manager oversees creating knowledge objects, implements naming conventions, normalizes event data and creates data models.

Interpretation
fields - automatically extracted when data is indexed
field extraction - can manually extract fields to add to your data
calculated fields - are added to events at search time and can result from calculations based on existing fields

Classification
event types - categorize fields based on search terms
transactions - groups of conceptually related events that span time

Enrichment
lookups - match field-value combinations in your event data with field-value combinations in external lookup tables. If Splunk software finds those field-value combinations in your lookup table, it appends the corresponding field-value combinations from the table to the events in your search.Lookups can reference fields that are added to events by field extractions, field aliases, and calculated fields. They cannot reference event types and tags. https://community.splunk.com/t5/Knowledge-Management/Can-I-use-field-extractions-and-lookups-to-extend-the-power-of/td-p/476268 
workflow actions - create links within events that interact with external resources or narrow search

Normalization
tags - create descriptive names for key:value pairs, enable searching for events which contain particular field values 
field aliases - normalize field names over multiple sources.  Any extracted field can have one or more aliases.

Models
hierarchical structure dataset which consists of searchs, events or transactions
